# architect

Build VR with VR. Use Vive or Rift with controllers to craft a world with your
own hands with zero code. Fully democratized content creation.

Built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

## Local Development

Architect uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

Use [aframe-motion-capture-components](https://aframe.io/blog/motion-capture/)
to record tests in VR and replay them on normal desktop mode. Architect comes
with several recordings used for development and testing in the `recordings/`
folder. Many of them will mostly be outdated as the application's UX changes.
